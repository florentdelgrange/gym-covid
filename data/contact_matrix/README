Procedures to construct the contact matrices used Abrams et al. (2021):
- Extract the raw contact matrices from Socrates, which results in an .RData file containing all matrix components:
	* Clone socrates: https://github.com/lwillem/socrates_rshiny
	* Copy the file get_epidemics2021_contact_matrices.R to the socrates_rshiny repo
	* Change directory to socrates_rshiny, and run: Rscript get_epidemics2021_contact_matrices.R
	* This will generate an RData file: contact_matrices_be_2010.RData
	* Copy this file to this directory as be_2010.RData
- Preprocess be_2010.RData file into a set of CSV files:
	*
